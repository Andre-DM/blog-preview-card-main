## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I didn't know how to import fonts from a local folder, I'm not sure if I did everything correctly, so I'd appreciate some feedback on that!

### Continued development

I would like to continue to work on the arrangement of elements on the web page, such as an image within a single div (I know this does not perfectly reflect the one in the design, I would like to understand what I am missing to be able to do this).

### Useful resources

- [PX to Rem Converter](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - It helped me a lot to convert px to rem.
